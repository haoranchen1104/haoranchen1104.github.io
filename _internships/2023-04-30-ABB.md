### Main Contributions

* Designed and implemented a simulation platform of large shipping scenarios based on ROS2 and Gazebo.
* Developed 3D lidar-based object detection algorithms for the real-time monitoring of containers, using the synthetic data generated from our simulation platform.
* Applied the model into real scenarios and mitigated the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data.
