**Abstract**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"Structure-from-motion is one of the most powerful tools for 3D reconstruction. While many methods have been proposed to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions in terms of accuracy, robustness, completeness and efficiency, there is still a remaining problem of scale ambiguity in Structure-from-Motion. In this project, we reconstruct the 3D structures of neighborhoods and aim to recover the metric with prior knowledge of GPS data when recording the videos. We propose a GPS-based localization method to improve the retrieval efficiency and optimize our reconstructions using Pose-Graph-Optimization."</i>

### Main Contributions

* Implemented scene reconstruction from videos based on Superpoint and Superglue;
* Designed an image pair retrieval strategy in large environments using GPS data;
* Optimized the large scene reconstruction with Pose Graph Optimization.
