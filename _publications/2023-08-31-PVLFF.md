**Abstract**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"Recently, methods have been proposed for 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Such methods are able to segment scenes into arbitrary classes given at run-time using their text description. In this paper, we propose to our knowledge the first algorithm for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation, simultaneously performing both semantic and instance segmentation. Our algorithm, Panoptic Vision-Language Feature Fields (PVLFF) learns a feature field of the scene, jointly learning vision-language features and hierarchical instance features through a contrastive loss function from 2D instance segment proposals on input frames. Our method achieves comparable performance against the state-of-the-art close-set 3D panoptic systems on the HyperSim, ScanNet and Replica dataset and outperforms current 3D open-vocabulary systems in terms of semantic segmentation. We additionally ablate our method to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model architecture. Our code will be available at [https://github.com/ethz-asl/autolabel](https://github.com/ethz-asl/autolabel)."</i>


### Main Contributions
* A hierarchical instance feature field that enables ob- taining 3D instance segments from 2D proposals using contrastive learning;
* To the best of our knowledge, the first zero-shot open- vocabulary panoptic segmentation system.
